# Energy Consumption Prediction - Final Project

This project is developed for the **Ironhack** bootcamp and aims to predict energy consumption for the next day, enabling power suppliers to make more informed decisions. By predicting future energy consumption, power suppliers can run their carbon-free power plants at full capacity at the optimal times, reducing reliance on fossil fuel-based plants and contributing to greener energy production.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts daily energy consumption. The predictions help power suppliers to plan and allocate energy production more efficiently. This project focuses on maximizing the usage of renewable energy sources by determining the optimal times to operate them based on predicted demand.

## Notebook

- **`mvp.ipynb`**: This is the only notebook in the project, and it contains all the steps from data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions. The notebook is designed to walk through the necessary steps to generate accurate predictions of energy consumption based on historical data.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and preparation to ensure the model works with accurate and normalized data.
- **Modeling**: Application of various machine learning models (such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks) to predict energy consumption.
- **Prediction**: The model predicts energy consumption for the upcoming day.
- **Optimization**: The goal is to predict consumption in a way that allows power suppliers to optimize the use of carbon-free energy sources.
